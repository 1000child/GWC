Loops:   In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as 
whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.
|while user_input == "yes":|
|  print"yes"              |
|  user_input()            |

Conditionals:   In computer science, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a 
programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition
evaluates to true or false.
|if user_input == "yes":|
|  print("yes")         |
|  user_input()         |

Functions:    In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure
or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some
operation but does not return a value.
|def generate_haiku():     |
|  print("This is a haiku")|


Variables:   In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. 
Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.
|user_input = input()|
